        "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Third Quarter 2024 Q&A Webcast. My name is Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and a number of other executives. Our Q3 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as webcast.\r\nDuring this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. [Operator Instructions] Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?"

        "Thank you. So to recap, as someone was saying, something that what the industry was seeing year-over-year declines in order volumes in Q3. Tesla at the same time has achieved record deliveries. In fact, I think if you look at EV companies worldwide, to the best of my knowledge, no EV company is even profitable. And I'm not -- to the best of my knowledge, there was no EV division of any company, of any existing car company that is profitable.\r\nSo it is notable that Tesla is profitable despite a very challenging automotive environment, and this quarter actually is a record Q3 for us. So we produced our [ seventh million ] vehicle actually just yesterday, so congratulations to the teams that made it happen in Tesla. That's staggering the immense amount of work to make 7 million cars. So you see, we all have -- the energy storage business is growing like wildfire with strong demand for both Megapack and Powerwall.\r\nAnd as you all know, on October 10, we laid out a vision for an autonomous and future that I think is very compelling that the Tesla team did a phenomenal job there with actually giving people an option to experience the future, where you have humanoid robots working among the craft, not with a canned video and a presentation or anything but walking among crowd so he drinks and whatnot. And we had 50 autonomous vehicles. There were 20 Cybercabs but there were an additional 30 Model Ys, operating fully autonomously the entire night, carrying thousands of people with no incidents the entire night.\r\nAnd all those who went there that worth emphasizing that the Cybercab had no steering wheel or brake or accelerator panels, meaning there was no way for anyone to intervene manually a unit if they wanted to and the whole night went very smoothly.\r\nSo regarding the vehicle business, we are still on track to deliver our affordable models starting in the first half of 2025. This is -- I think probably people want should they assume for vehicle sales growth next year. And at the risk of -- to take a bit of risk here, I do want to give some rough estimate, which I think it's 20% to 30% vehicle growth next year, notwithstanding negative external events, like if there's some force majeure events, like some big war breaks out or interest rates go sky high or something like that. We can't overcome massive force majeure events.\r\nBut I think with our lower-cost vehicles with the advent of autonomy, something like a 20% to 30% growth next year is my best guess. And then Cybercab reaching volume production in '26. I do feel confident of Cybercab reaching volume production in '26, just starting production, reaching volume production in '26. And that should be substantial, but we're aiming for at least 2 million units a year of Cybercab. That will be in more than 1 factory but I think it's at least 2 million units a year, maybe 4 million ultimately.\r\nSo yes, these are just my best guesses but if you ask me my best guesses, those are my best guesses. The cell 4680 lines, the team is actually doing great work there. The 4680 is rapidly approaching the point where it is the most competitive cell. So when you consider the fully landed -- the cost of a battery pack fully landed in the U.S., net of incentives and duties, 4680 is tracking to be the most competitive, maybe lower cost per kilowatt hour, fully considered than any other alternative, which is -- we're not quite there yet but we're close to being there, which I think is extremely exciting.\r\nAnd we've got several -- a lot of ideas to go well beyond that. So I think there's -- if we execute well, the 4680 -- we'll have the -- the Tesla internally produced cell will be the most cost competitive cell in North America, a testament to the tremendous amount of hard work there done by the team. So that's to say we'll continue to buy a lot of cells from our competitors. I tend not to -- to provide -- to make cells just internally. So I don't want to sort of here.\r\nWe're obviously increasing substantially our vehicle output and our stationary storage output so we need a lot of cells. And most of them will still come from suppliers. But I think it is some good news that the Tesla internal cell is likely to be the most competitive in the U.S.\r\nSo with respect to autonomy, as people are experiencing in the cars really from week to week, there are significant improvements and the miles between interventions. So with the new version 12.5 release of [indiscernible] and Cybertruck, combining the code into a single stack so that the city driving and the engine and highway driving are 1 stack, which is a big improvement for the highway driving. So it's just all neural nets. And the release of actually Smart -- we try to have a sense of humor here.\r\nAnd we're also -- so that's 12.5. Version 13 of FSD is going out soon. will elaborate more on that later in the call. We expect to see roughly a 5- or 6-fold improvement in miles between interventions compared to 12.5. And actually, looking at the year as whole, the improvement in miles interventions, we think will be at least [indiscernible] So that's a very dramatic improvement in the course of the year, and we expect that trend to continue next year.\r\nSo the current total expectation, internal expectation for the Tesla FSD having longer miles [indiscernible] human is the second quarter of next year, which means it may end up being in the third quarter but it's next -- it seems extremely likely to be next year. Ashok, do you want to maybe"

        "Yes. miles between critical interventions, mentioned by Elon already made 100x improvement with 12.5 from starting of this year and then with v13 release, we expect to be 1,000x from the beginning, from January of this year on production software. And this came in because of technology improvements going to end-to-end, having higher frame rate, partly also helped by hardware force, more capabilities, so on. And we hope that we continue to scale the neural network, the data, the training compute, et cetera. By Q2 next year, we should cross over the average, even in miles per critical intervention [indiscernible] in that case."

        "So that's not sandbagging or anything else. Our internal estimate is Q2 of next year to be safer than human and then to continue with rapid improvements thereafter.\r\nA vast majority of humanity has no idea that Tesla could drive themselves so especially for something like a Model 3 or Model Y, it looks like a normal car. So you don't expect a normal car to be able to be intelligent enough to drive itself. A Cybercab looks different. A Cybertruck looks different, but Model Y and Model 3 are, look, they're good-looking cars, but look at the fairly normal. You don't expect a fairly normal looking car to have the intelligence, enough AI to be able to drive itself. But it does.\r\nSo we do want to expose that to more people, and so we're doing -- every time we have a significant improvement in the software, we'll roll out another sort of 30-day trial so to encourage people to try it again. And we are seeing a significant improvement in adoption. So the take rate for FSD has improved substantially, especially after the 10/10 event.\r\nYes. So there's no need to wait for robotaxi or Cybercab to experience full autonomy. We expect to achieve that next year with the -- with our existing vehicle line."

        "Yes, sure. It's David. We showed some screenshots of this in the Q1 shareholder deck, and this is real. We've been testing it for the good part of the year. And the building blocks that we needed in order to build this functionality and deliver it to production, we've been thinking about working on for years.\r\nIt just so happens that we've used those building blocks to deliver great features for our customers in the meantime, such as sharing your profile, synchronizing it across cars so that every single car that you jump into, whether it's another car that you own or a car that somebody has loaned to you or a rental car that you jump into, it looks exactly like yours. Everything synchronized, seat mirror positions, media, navigation, everything is the same, just what you would expect from one of our robotaxis.\r\nBut we gave that functionality to our customers right now because we've built it intending for it to be used in the future, but we're releasing that functionality now. All the end-to-end cybersecurity that we knew we were going to need to deliver that functionality, sending a navigation destination from your phone to the vehicle. And so we're doing that now with the the ridehailing app, but it's something that we've made available to customers for years.\r\nSeeing the progress on a route in the mobile app, that's something you'll need for the ridehailing app, but again, we released it in the meantime. So it's not like we're just starting to think about this stuff right now while we're building out the early stages of our ridehailing network. We've been thinking about this for quite a long time, and we're excited to get the functionality out there."

        "Yes. And we do expect to roll out ridehailing in California and Texas next year to the public. Now California is somewhere -- there's quite a long regulatory approval process. I think we should get approval next year but it's contingent upon regulatory approval. Texas is a lot faster so it's -- we'll definitely have available in Texas and probably have it available in California, subject to regulatory approval.\r\nAnd then -- and maybe some other states actually next year as well, but at least California and Texas. So I think that would be very exciting. That's really a profound change. Tesla becomes more than a sort of vehicle and a battery manufacturing company at that point. So we published Q3 vehicle safety report, which shows 1 pack for every [indiscernible] pilot that compressed the U.S. average of crash roughly every 700,000 miles. So it's currently showing a 10x safety improvement relative to the U.S. average.\r\nAnd we continue to expand our AI training capacity to accommodate the needs of both FSD and Optimus. We are currently not training compute-constrained. [indiscernible] probably the big limiting factors of the FSD is actually getting so good that it takes us a while to actually find mistakes. And when you start getting to where it can take 10,000 miles to find a mistake, it takes a while to actually figure out which it is, is software A better than software B? It actually takes a while to figure it out because neither 1 of them makes the mistakes, would take a long time to make mistakes. So it's actually the single biggest limiting factor is how long does it take us to figure out which version is better? Sort of a high-class problem.\r\nObviously, having a giant fleet is very helpful for breaking this out. And then with Optimus, we showed a mass improvement in Optimus exterior movement on October 10. And our next-gen which is 22 degrees freedom, which is double the prior and for. It's extremely human-like and so it's much better at tactile sensing. It's really -- I feel confident in saying that we have the most advanced humanoid robot by a long shot. And we're moreover the only company that really has all of the ingredients necessary to scale humanoid robots.\r\nBecause the things that what other companies are missing is that they're missing the AI brain, that they're missing people to really scale to very high-volume production. So you see some impressive video demos, but what like the localized AI and the volume to very high numbers. As I've said on a few occasions before, I think Optimus will ultimately be [indiscernible] part so I think has a good chance of being the most viable product that we made.\r\nFor the energy business, that's doing extremely well. And [indiscernible] ahead is The Lathrop Megapack factory reached 200 Megapacks a week, which is now a 40 gigawatt hour a year run rate. And we have a second factory in Shanghai that will begin with the 20 gigawatt hour year run rate in Q1 next year so next quarter. And that will also scale out. It won't be long before we're shipping 100 gigawatt hours a year stationary storage at Tesla.\r\nAnd will that -- I mean, -- that will ultimately grow, I think, to multiple terawatt hours per year. It has to actually in order to have a sustainable energy future. If you're not at the terawatt scale, you're not really moving the needle. So if you look at our very complicated last master plan, which I think actually is too much detail, I'll maybe ask to analyze it and give us the TLDR on the management plan.\r\nWe shared in that master plan that it is possible to take all of us to a fully sustainable energy situation using sustainable energy, power generation and batteries and electric transport. And there were no fundamental material limitations, like there's not some very rare material that we don't have enough of. We actually have enough with raw materials to take all of human civilization, make it fully sustainable and dramatically increased its trust usage would still be fully sustainable.\r\nOne way to think of the progress of a civilization space a little esoteric but is percentage completion of at scale. So [indiscernible] scale, 1 would be you're using all the power of a planet. We're currently less than 1% on Level 1. Level 2 would be using all the power of the sun, and Level 3, all of power of the galaxy so we've got a long way to go, long way to go.\r\nWhen you think in terms, it becomes obvious that by far, the biggest source of energy is the sun. Everything else is in the. So concluding, Tesla is focused on building the future of energy, transport, robotics and AI. And this is a time when others are just focused on managing around near-term trends. We think what we're doing is the right approach. And if we execute on our objectives, I think we will, my prediction is Tesla will become the most valuable company in the world and probably by a long shot.\r\nI want to thank the Tesla team once again for strong execution in a tough operating environment, and we're looking forward to building an incredibly exciting future. Thank you."

        "Thanks. Our Q3 results were positive and once again demonstrate the scale to which the business has evolved or with generation of record operating cash flows of $6.3 billion. Our automotive revenues grew both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. While we had unit volume growth, we did experience a reduction in ASPs primarily due to the impact of financing incentives. As a reminder, we are providing these incentives primarily using third-party banks and financial institution and recognize the cost of these incentives as an upfront reduction to revenue.\r\nWe released FSD for Cybertruck and other features like actually small [indiscernible] like Elon talked about in North America, which contributed $326 million of revenues in the quarter. We continue to see elevated levels of revenue [indiscernible] sales with over $2 billion of revenues so far this year. To expand on this at an industry level, China continues to outperform U.S. and Europe by a factor of 3. And if there is something to be learned from that, this gives a signal of what is to come in other regions. As customers' acceptance of EV growth, we feel that is the right strategy to build affordable and more compelling leads.\r\nOur focus remains on growing unit volume while avoiding a buildup of inventory. To support this strategy, we're continuing to offer extremely compelling vehicle financing options in When you compare any vehicle in our lineup with other OEMs, we believe our vehicles provide much better value, particularly when you consider the safety features, performance and unparalleled software functionalities, like David also talked about, include also what Ashok had talked about around autonomy, music options, parental controls, and much more.\r\nWhile every vehicle in our lineup comes up with these capabilities, there is an awareness gap not just with buyers but at times even with existing owners. We plan on making these more visible in our interactions with both existing and future customers. Automotive margins improved quarter-over-quarter as a result of a feature release discussed before. Increase in our overall production and delivery volume, benefit from the marketing pricing and more localized deliveries in region, which resulted in lower freight",
        "Sustaining these margins in Q4, however, will be challenging, given the current economic environment. Note that we are focused on the cost per vehicle, and there are numerous work streams within the company to squeeze out cost without compromising on customer experience."

Can they afford monthly payment? So most likely, we'll see continue to decline in interest rates, which helps with affordability of vehicles."

        "Yes. I mean, that is 1 trend which we observed in the industry that because of the affordability being impacted because of interest rates, people are wanted the cars longer, especially in the U.S. And that is actually having an impact on the overall industry, too. As we discussed earlier, as we discussed in back orders, energy deployments fluctuate quarter-on-quarter due to customer readiness, location of orders being fulfilled, and not necessarily an indicator of demand of production within the quarter.\r\nWhile we did see a decline in Q3, we expect to grow deployment sequentially in Q4 to end the year with more than double of last year. Energy margins in Q3 were a record at more than 30%. This is a function of mix of projects being deployed in the quarter. Note that there will be fluctuation in margins as we manage through deployments and our inventory. Our pipeline and backlog continue to grow quarter-over-quarter as we fill our 2025 production slots, and we are doing our best to keep up with the demand.\r\nJust coming back on automotive margins. I talked about -- sorry, I talked about what is happening. One other thing which I want to also share is that we're seeing -- that we will continue to keep whatever we can to, like I said before, about squeezing of the cost. But this is something which we also are very capable of. I mean, just in Q3, we faced our lowest cost per vehicle, and that is a trend which we want to keep focused on.\r\nThen going on to service and other. We continue to show improvements in Q3. This was a result of better performance, both in our service  as well as it includes collision, part sales, and merchandise and continued growth in supercharging. These fee-based revenues will continue to grow as the overall fleet size increases. Our operating expenses declined quarter-over-quarter and on year-on-year basis. This is partially due to the restructuring we undertook in Q2. Cost savings from these initiatives were partially offset by increase in costs related to our AI efforts.\r\nWe've started using the GPU cluster based out of our factory house and ahead of schedule and are on track to get 50,000 GPUs deployed in Texas by the end of this month. One thing which I'd like to elaborate is that we're being really judicious on our AI compute spend to and saying how best we can utilize the existing infrastructure before making further investments. On the CapEx front, we had about $3.5 billion in the quarter. This was a sequential increase largely because of investments in AI compute. We now expect our CapEx for the year to be in excess of $11 billion.\r\nWe shared our vision for the future at the event at the beginning of the month. The Tesla team is hyper-focused on delivering on that version. All efforts are underway to make it a reality. While we've achieved significant progress this year, it will take time to get this as we find new and incredibly complex technologies and navigate a fragmented regulatory landscape. The future is incredibly bright, and I want to thank the Tesla team once again for all their help."

I mean, it's going to be -- I've actually said this many years ago, but that in my strong belief and I believe that is panning out to be true, very obvious retrospect is that the future is autonomous electric vehicles. And nonautonomous gasoline vehicles here will be like riding a horse and using a foot bone. It's not that there are no horses. Yes, there are some but they're unusual. They're niche.\r\nAnd so everything is going to be electric autonomous. I think this is like it should be, frankly, blindingly obvious at this point, that is the future. So a lot of automotive companies, most of the companies have not internalized this, which is surprising because we're shouting from the rooftops for such a long time. And it will accrue to their detriments in the future. But all of our vehicles in the future will be autonomous.\r\nYes. So all the vehicles that we've really made, almost 7 million vehicles, the vast majority are capable of autonomy. And we're currently making on the order of 35,000 autonomous vehicles a week to say Waymo's entire fleet is less than -- they've less than 1,000 corners. We're making 35,000 a week."

The reason it hasn't come out yet is because it is -- Roadster is not just icing on the cake, it's the cherry on the icing on the cake. And so our larger mission is to accelerate the progress towards a sustainable energy future, trying to do things that maximize probably the future is good for humanity and for Earth.\r\nAnd so that necessarily means that like the things like that are deserved. We'd like -- we'd all love to work on the Tesla -- next-gen -- it is super fun. And we are working on it, but it has to come behind the more things that have a more serious impact on the of the world. So just thank you to all our long-suffering Tesla Roadster deposit holders. And we are actually finally making progress on that. And we're close to finalizing the design on it.",

I think that trend will continue into the next few quarters as well by the first solution rapidly with hardware 4 and then backwardate and it just takes longer to those things because it's not fundamentally supported in the hardware and it's emulated.

        "I was wondering about like the compute you're ramping up. So you gave like interesting statistics on how much you have and you said you don't feel your compute constrained. And I was wondering how you are putting to work this additional compute. Is that a game for you of creating like larger and larger models like next generation of models that are larger the way OpenAI go from GPT-3 to GPT-4? Or is that more like you're set on your model and you need to throw more and more compute to accelerate the pace of learning to improve reliability.\r\nAnd then I had a quick follow-up real quick on your rollout in Texas and in California next year. The plan, as you see today, is it to roll out like a fleet or 2 with cars that will start with like a supervisory like some onboard supervision, someone sitting at the wheel just in case and removing the supervisors progressively? Or are you aiming for going fully fledged without even a human supervisor when you get started?"

        "Okay. Well, I guess regarding -- the first part of the question, The nature of real world AI is different from LLM in that you have a massive amount of context. So like the -- you've got a case of Tesla cameras that [indiscernible] if you include tunnel camera that -- so you've got some context. And that is then distilled down into a small number of control outputs, whereas it's like it's very rare to have, in fact, I'm not sure any LLM out there can do gigabytes of context.\r\nAnd then you've got to then process that in the car with a very small amount of compute power. So it's all doable and it's happening, but it is a different problem than what, say, a Gemini or OpenAI is doing. And now part of the way you can make up for the fact that the inference computer is quite small. It is by spending a lot of effort on training. And just like a human the way you train on something, the less metal work takes when you try to -- when you do it, like when the first time like a driving it absolves your whole mind.\r\nBut then as you train more and more on driving different than the driving becomes a background task. It doesn't -- it only solves a small amount of your mental capacity because you have a lot of training. So we can make up for the fact that the insurance computers -- it's tiny compared to a 10-kilowatt bank of GPUs because you've got a few hundred watts of inference compute. We can make up that with heavy training.\r\nSo yes, that's -- and then there's also vast amounts to the actual petabytes of data coming in tremendous. And then sorting out what training is important of the vast amounts of video training video data coming complete what is actually most important for trading. That's quite difficult. But as I said, we're not currently training compute constraint. -- had you want levering"

So the validation network to picking the models because as mentioned this pretty large. We had to drive a lot of miles going close to. We do have simulation and other ways to get those metrics.\r\nThose 2 help, but in the end, that's a big bottleneck. That's why we're not trying to compete constraint alone. And there's other access of scaling as well, which is a data figuring office as more useful. That is an important as focusing on that."

I do think Tesla is the most efficient in the world in terms of inference compute like because of necessity, we have to be very good at efficient firms. We can't put 10 kilowatts of GPUs in a car.
